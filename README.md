This application will have features such as, sorting and filtering reviewed repositories, registering a user, logging in and creating a review, deleting a review for a repository.

The app was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and is running on Expo.

## Configuration

Set up the rate-repository-api server by following the setup instructions in the repository's [README](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/rate-repository-api/blob/master/README.md). Note that if you are using an emulator for development it is recommended to run the server and the emulator on the same computer. This eases network requests considerably.

#### To get set up, run the following in your cloned directory

`npm install`

`npm start`
